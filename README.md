Clicky Game - homework week 19 by Mukti Pancholi


This is a react app called Travel Clicky Game.  The application renders different images to the screen. The game  keeps track of the user's score. The user's score increments when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score  resets to 0 if they click the same image more than once.  Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page  shuffle themselves in a random order.  Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
